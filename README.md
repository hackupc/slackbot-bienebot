# Biene bot

## Overview
ðŸ¤– HackUPC Slack helper bot implemented in Python and using LUIS by Microsoft for making IA interaction easier.

## Requirements
1. Python 3.7+
2. docker-ce (as provided by docker package repos)
3. docker-compose (as provided by PyPI)

## Recommendations
Usage of [virtualenv](https://realpython.com/blog/python/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) is recommended for package library / runtime isolation.

## Usage
To run the server locally, please execute the following from the root directory:

1. Setup virtual environment

```bash
virtualenv -p /usr/local/bin/python3.7 env
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.lock
```

3. Copy `__init__.template.py` to `__init__.py` with correct values

4. Run Startup server as python module

```bash
python3 -m hackupc.bienebot
```

## Deploy locally

via docker-compose
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Restart locally

```bash
sh restart.sh
```

## Log

Run logs from docker-compose once it's up and running
```bash
docker-compose logs -f --timestamps bienebot
```

## Production

Inspired on this [tutorial](https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2015/10/how-to-autorun-a-python-script-on-boot-using-systemd/) to understand and set it up as in our server.

Needs: Systemd.

- Edit this file `/lib/systemd/system/biene-bot.service`
- Add this content

    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=Biene bot
    After=multi-user.target

    ExecStart=/home/user/project_folder/env/bin/python -m hackupc.bienebot
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

- Replace `project_folder` by the name of the folder where the project is located
