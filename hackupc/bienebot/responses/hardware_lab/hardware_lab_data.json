    "Help": [
        "I can tell you about how to request hardware or which hardware is available, just asking me about it :blush:"
    ],
    "How": [
        "On your MyHackUPC profile (https://my.hackupc.com) you can request as many hardware devices as you need for your project and find a list of the hardware available. Once requested, the hardware is reserved for you for a certain amount of time. You should go to the Hardware Lab desk (same location as InfoDesk or Baggage Check-in) to retrieve the item before the time's up. To retrieve the item you'll have to lend your ID in the desk, so don't forget to take it with you! :smile:"
